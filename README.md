# Advanced-Higher-Project-

This was the project requiured by my Advanced Higher Computer Science course. 

The requirements for this project were:
A linked program and database with multiple tables. 
An array of object. 
A sort. 

This is a word typing speed game. It will display 3 words and the user will have to type them out in a fast time. They will score points depending on the length of the word. When the player has made 3 mistakes or missed 3 word the game will end and the score will be stored in the database. 

This project was made on the website replit and the sqlite library was used for the database interconnectivity. The additional bat files were made to help with preventing database corruption as well as allowing me to compile the project easier with the extra libraries used. This was also my first attempt at multi threading which did not work nearly as efficently as it could have. 

This code mostly works and it still will allow you to play the game however there is quite a few issues with the leaderboard and the multi threading. However since this code is partially lecacy code and some of the methods used were already outdated at the point of completion This project will be left as it is.
